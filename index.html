  <h1>Creative Computing 2021/22</h1>
  <p>The activity introduces different ways on how to create games, music and art with computer programs.</p>

  <h2>Part Ia: Basic concepts of coding with Scratch</h2>
  <p>At the beginning we learn the basics of coding by doing small animations and games with Scratch.</p>

  <h2>Part Ib: Web design</h2>
  <p>Here we either learn the basics of web design with HTML and CSS or deepen our knowledge.
    Throughout the year we publish our work on a website on Github Pages. That's what you see right now.</p>

  <h2>Part II: Sound and music</h2>
  <p>We learn about audio, we create sound effects and simple music sequences using the program MAX 8.</p>

  <h2>Part III: Animation</h2>
  <p>We learn to animate characters on screen and create a short video with Alice 3.</p>

  <h2>Part IV: Coding and art</h2>
  <p>We use our knowledge to create a piece of art or a game combining hardware and software. We learn and use the languages P5.JS
    and Processing for that purpose.</p>

  <p>By the end of the year, we will have had a good exposure to various areas at the intersection of arts and computer science. This website will
    serve as a blog to document my progress. </p>
